### 😶‍🌫️ Introduction to the wiki

- Why did you write this wiki?From the very beginning **Dominated by fear v1.0** to the current **Dominated by Fear 2: Containment Breach** and then to the establishment of **MoY Studio**, from the initial obscurity to the current fame, we have experienced a lot, and we are gradually going to the world.In this process, we understood that we could not only rely on platforms such as **Bilibili** and **YouTube**, but also needed an encyclopedia that would be more relevant to our studio's fans, and this wiki project was born.

- This wikipedia contains some problems and tips for all the projects of our studio (including the server) ~~(most of them come from issue, QQ group chat)~~ and some real-time and features of Minecraft in the current **Java Edition** and so on
